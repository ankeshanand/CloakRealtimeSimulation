CloakRealtimeSimulation
=======================

This repository contains a simulation of how the cloak would deal with realtime data and provide analytics. 

This is a QT Project which uses a modified K-Anloymity Algorithm and the Cloak Framework to provide with a real-time Analytics Dasboard.

The front-end is rendered using d3.js and Leaflet over Qt Webkit. Data-Parsing and Backend stuff have been carried out in C++, and MongoDB has been used for Daatabase Management.
